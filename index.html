    <h2>The Benefits of using AI to do schoolwork.</h2>
    <p>Usually in schools, AI is looked at as a way to cheat on a test or an assignment.<br> 
    But when it is used properly as a tool to answer specific questions or solve simple solutions, <br>
it can be very useful. Not all use of AI is to gain an unfair advantage in school. It can help in <br>
many different situations, such as answering a question or giving prompts or ideas to write about <br>
from a specific topic.</p>
